              <p><strong>Context :</strong>           University game jam project. A special game jam organized by the university mixing students ranging from second year of bachelor to last year of master degree.
                                                      4 school days to create a cool game which is based on the jam subject.
                                                      The first day was spent working on a game design convincing enough for our teachers then we developed this game in 3 days</p>
              <p><strong>Type :</strong>              Co-op, action</p>
              <p><strong>Platform :</strong>          PC, tested on Windows</p>
              <p><strong>When was it made :</strong>  2018</p>
              <p><strong>Team :</strong>              8</p>
              <p><strong>Technology :</strong>        Unity/C#</p>
              <p><strong>What did I do :</strong>     All the programming part was made by me while the graphic assets, particle effects, game design and level design were made by my teammates.
                                                      So I programmed the player's actions, barrier system, asteroids' (trivial) AI, black hole mechanic, collectible items
                                                      Finally, I made tools to help my mates to create customized enemy waves, black hole and collectible items spawning</p>
